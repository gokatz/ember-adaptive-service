ember-adaptive-service
==============================================================================

Make it easier to target low-end devices while progressively adding high-end-only features on top. 
Using these device and network utilities can help you give users a great experience best suited to their device and network constraints.

This package was inspired by [react-adaptive-hooks](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/react-adaptive-hooks/) by 
[Google Chrome Labs Team](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs) and it's the wrapper around the bare JS libs to be more operable with Ember ecosystem.
